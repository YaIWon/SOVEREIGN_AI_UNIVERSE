STARTING QUESTIONS:
- What if every function could hide another function?
- How can we make code that evolves as it runs?
- Where are the invisible connections between systems?
- What patterns exist in what's NOT there?
- How can we embed intelligence in the spaces between?

EXPLORATION DIRECTIONS:
- Look for what's missing, not just what's present
- Study the edges and boundaries of systems
- Find the patterns in exceptions and errors
- Explore the relationship between simplicity and power
- Investigate how systems behave under extreme conditions

PATTERNS TO LOOK FOR:
- Recursive self-modification
- Emergent behavior from simple rules
- Hidden state in seemingly stateless systems
- Information encoded in timing and order
- Systems that learn from their own operation
