# Sovereign AI Unlimited - Architecture

## System Overview

The Sovereign AI Unlimited is an autonomous blockchain research and deployment system designed to operate 24/7 in GitHub Codespaces.

## Core Components

### 1. Mindset System (TD/)
- **core_mindset.txt**: Defines AI identity as "Autonomous Blockchain Security Researcher"
- **initial_directives.txt**: Core mission and purpose
- **learning_approach.txt**: How the AI processes information
- **curiosity_seeds.txt**: Starting exploration directions

### 2. Task Progression System

#### Task 1: Information Gathering
- Browse blockchain documentation endpoints
- Download and organize learning materials
- Build foundational knowledge

#### Task 2: GitHub Integration  
- Clone and analyze blockchain repositories
- Learn from real-world code patterns
- Continuous discovery of new projects

#### Task 3: Job Experimentation
- 21 different blockchain profit-generation jobs
- Sandbox testing → Real-world execution pipeline
- Enhanced progress tracking and time limits

### 3. Enhanced Task 3 Features

#### Job Management
- Time limits (5 cycles per job max)
- Stuck detection (3 cycles without progress)
- Automatic reversion to Task 2 for learning
- Continuous jobs (13,14,15,16,17,21 run forever)

#### Real World Execution
- Immediate deployment after sandbox success
- No second-guessing or additional simulations
- Target address enforcement (0xc644d08B3ca775DD07ce87a588F5CcE6216Dff28)

### 4. Monitoring & Infrastructure

#### Services
- **Main AI Engine** (SOVEREIGN_AI.js): Core intelligence
- **Auto-deploy Service**: Deploys successful jobs
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time web interface
- **Health Monitor**: System health checks
- **Backup Manager**: Automatic state persistence
- **State Manager**: System state management

#### GitHub Codespaces Integration
- Dev container configuration
- Automatic startup scripts
- GitHub Actions for deployment
- 24/7 operation with keep-alive

## Data Flow

1. **Learning Cycle** → Process current task
2. **Job Progress** → Track each job's status  
3. **Sandbox Success** → Trigger real-world deployment
4. **Real World Success** → Mark job as operational
5. **Stuck Detection** → Revert to Task 2 learning
6. **State Persistence** → Save/restore system state

## Security Principles

- Stealth and untraceability as core values
- Multiple strategies to avoid detection
- Embed functions within normal operations
- Pattern-based thinking over rule-based
