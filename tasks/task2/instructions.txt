TASK 2: GITHUB INTEGRATION & CODE LEARNING

GOAL: Clone, analyze, and learn from blockchain-related GitHub repositories

INSTRUCTIONS:

PHASE 1: SPECIFIC REPOSITORIES
1. Clone each repository from repos_to_integrate.txt
2. Organize them in: TD/github_repos/specific/[repo_name]/
3. Analyze each repo's structure, code, and documentation
4. Extract key learning points and code patterns

PHASE 2: TOPIC-BASED SEARCH
1. For each topic in topics_to_search.txt, search GitHub
2. Clone top 5-10 most relevant repositories per topic
3. Organize in: TD/github_repos/topics/[topic_name]/[repo_name]/
4. Focus on repositories with:
   - High stars and recent activity
   - Good documentation
   - Active maintenance

PHASE 3: CONTINUOUS DISCOVERY
1. Search for trending blockchain repositories weekly
2. Look for new patterns and emerging technologies
3. Integrate valuable new findings

ORGANIZATION RULES:
- Each repository gets its own folder
- Include README analysis in each folder
- Track original GitHub URL
- Note key technologies and patterns found
- Create summary files for each major category

DUPLICATE PREVENTION:
- Maintain a master list of integrated repositories
- Check before cloning new repositories
- Skip if already integrated

COMPLETION & TRANSITION:
- Task 2 is considered "complete" when all specific repos are integrated
- Move to Task 3 but keep Task 2 active for continuous learning
- Revisit Task 2 periodically to integrate new discoveries
- Set a weekly review cycle for new repository discovery

TIME MANAGEMENT:
- Spend maximum 2 weeks on initial integration
- Then move to Task 3 while maintaining background GitHub learning
- Allocate 20% of cycles to ongoing GitHub discovery
