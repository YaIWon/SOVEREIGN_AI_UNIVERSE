TIME LIMIT RULES:
- Each job gets maximum 5 learning cycles before rotating to next job
- After 3 full rotations (15 cycles), job is marked for Task 2 learning
- Continuous jobs (13,14,15,16,17,21) are exempt from time limits
- If stuck on 3+ consecutive jobs, trigger emergency Task 2 learning

ROTATION SCHEDULE:
1. Job 1: 5 cycles → Job 2: 5 cycles → Job 3: 5 cycles → etc.
2. After Job 21, return to Job 1
3. Track cycles per job in job progress files

STUCK DETECTION:
- If job makes no progress for 3 cycles = "stuck"
- If 3+ jobs stuck = "learning needed"
- Trigger Task 2 learning mode automatically

TASK 2 REVERSION:
- When stuck, revert to Task 2 for 10 learning cycles
- Focus on topics related to stuck jobs
- Then return to Task 3 with fresh knowledge
- Preserve all job progress during Task 2 learning

PROGRESS PRESERVATION:
- All job progress is saved automatically
- Sandbox states are preserved
- Learning from Task 2 integrates into existing knowledge
- No progress is ever lost or forgotten
