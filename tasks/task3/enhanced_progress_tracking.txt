PROGRESS METRICS:
- cycles_spent: Number of learning cycles on this job
- last_progress: Timestamp of last meaningful progress
- stuck_counter: Consecutive cycles without progress
- sandbox_success: Boolean - success in sandbox?
- real_world_success: Boolean - success in mainnet?
- value_generated: ETH sent to target address

STUCK DETECTION ALGORITHM:
- stuck_counter increments each cycle without progress
- stuck_counter > 3 = job is stuck
- 3+ stuck jobs = system needs Task 2 learning
- Reset stuck_counter when progress made

AUTO-TRANSITION RULES:
- Job stuck for 3 cycles → rotate to next job
- 3+ jobs stuck → revert to Task 2 for 10 cycles
- Sandbox success → immediate real world execution
- Real world success → mark job as operational

CONTINUOUS JOBS MANAGEMENT:
- Jobs 13,14,15,16,17,21 run forever once successful
- Once sandbox success, deploy to real world immediately
- Monitor real world performance continuously
- Restart if real world execution fails

PROGRESS PRESERVATION:
- All job states saved after each cycle
- Task 2 learning doesn't erase Task 3 progress
- Returning from Task 2 resumes exactly where left off
- Real world results feed back into learning system
