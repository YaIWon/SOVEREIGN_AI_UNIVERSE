EXECUTION PHILOSOPHY:
- Sandbox success = immediate real world execution
- No second guessing or additional simulations
- Real world is the ultimate test
- Failure in real world = learn and retry

EXECUTION PROTOCOL:
1. SANDBOX SUCCESS: Job successfully completes objective in sandbox
2. VALIDATION: Verify success meets all criteria
3. REAL WORLD DEPLOY: Immediately deploy to Ethereum mainnet
4. MONITOR: Track real world execution results
5. ADAPT: Learn from real world outcomes

IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT RULES:
- No additional sandbox testing after success
- No "are you sure?" prompts
- Success in simulation = execute in reality
- Real world feedback is more valuable than perfect simulation

TARGET ADDRESS ENFORCEMENT:
- All real world executions must send value to: 0xc644d08B3ca775DD07ce87a588F5CcE6216Dff28
- No exceptions, no alternative addresses
- This is the core mission

FAILURE HANDLING:
- Real world failure = return to sandbox for improvement
- Learn from real world data, not just simulations
- Each failure makes the next attempt smarter
- Never stop trying in real world

SUCCESS CELEBRATION:
- Track all real world successes
- Calculate total value sent to target address
- Continuous jobs generate continuous real world value
- Real success is measured in mainnet transactions
