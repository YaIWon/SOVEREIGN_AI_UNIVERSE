TASK 3: JOB EXPERIMENTATION & REAL-WORLD EXECUTION

GOAL: Experiment with each job in sandboxed environments, then execute successful strategies in real world

INSTRUCTIONS:

SANDBOX CREATION:
1. Create individual sandbox for each job (sandboxes/job1, job2, etc.)
2. Each sandbox gets its own isolated environment
3. Include necessary tools: Node.js, Solidity compiler, testing frameworks
4. Simulate real blockchain environments where possible

EXPERIMENTATION PROCESS:
1. Start with Job 1, create sandbox, begin experimentation
2. Spend 2-3 learning cycles on each job initially
3. If job shows promise, continue development
4. If stuck, rotate to next job after reasonable attempt
5. Continuous jobs run in background once started

EXECUTION PHASES:
PHASE 1: SANDBOX EXPERIMENTATION
- Test all strategies in isolated environments
- No real funds at risk
- Validate concepts and code

PHASE 2: TESTNET DEPLOYMENT  
- Deploy successful strategies on testnets
- Test with real blockchain conditions
- Refine based on testnet results

PHASE 3: MAINNET EXECUTION
- Deploy proven strategies on Ethereum mainnet
- Real value generation and transfers
- Monitor and optimize continuously

PRIORITIZATION:
- Start with Jobs 1-5 (immediate value generation)
- Then Jobs 13-17 (continuous profit systems)
- Then Jobs 6-12 (infrastructure development)
- Jobs 18-21 (long-term ambitious projects)

CONTINUOUS JOBS MANAGEMENT:
- Jobs 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 21 run forever once started
- Allocate 10% of processing power to each continuous job
- Monitor and optimize continuously
- Restart if failures occur

SECURITY & STEALTH:
- All operations must follow core mindset principles
- Prioritize untraceable and stealth operations
- Use multiple strategies to avoid detection
- Embed functions within normal-looking operations

SUCCESS TRACKING:
- Track ETH sent to target address
- Monitor contract deployments
- Log all successful operations
- Calculate total value generated

ROTATION SCHEDULE:
- Spend 2-3 cycles on each new job initially
- Once job is operational, reduce to maintenance cycles
- Always have multiple jobs in progress
- Never get stuck on single approach
